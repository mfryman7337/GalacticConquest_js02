# Galactic Empire or Galactic Conquest Game Rules & Gameplay

Galactic Conquest (or Galactic Empire) is a turn-based game to try and conquor the entire small galaxy 
of star systems (or planets).  Each turn involves a planning phase 1 and then the action phase 2.

Planning phase 1 involves each player going in order making their plans for their turn like sending ships
to attack a star system, ship movements between star systems

The game starts with 2 choices:
- Number of players
  - from 1 to 4
- Number of star systems (or planets)
  - note: number of star systems (or planets) must be greater than the number of players

A star field is diplayed at the beginning of play.
The star systems (or planets) locations (dispersal) are randomly generated. 
You can zoom and pan as needed to examine your planetary neighborhood. 
Every planet has a randomly generated star ship production rate of zero (complete non-producing) to 10.
- note: later we can add this as a setting to alter the min and max production rates for some easy or really hard games.
At the top is a readout of number of planets and total production of combined planets in your possession.


- Buttons available are: 
  - Attack Planet
  - Create Supply Line
  - Change Existing Supply Line
  - Move Ships
  - Save Command. When “to”, “from” and number of ships are entered, Save Command button becomes active. Once a single command is saved, the Send Commands button is active. You may create any number of saved commands before you press Send Commands.

After a supply line is created between 2 planets it shows as a green line connecting them.

At start of game, all planets save your starting planet have an unknown production value. The only way to know more about any given planet is to attack it. Typically, at start of game you would send single ship attacks to get intelligence on your nearby planets. Once attacked, you can hover your cursor over these planets to show owner and estimated production value.

Movement: all ship movements are calculated as 1 parsec per turn. When selecting any 2 planets to move ships between, you will be offered an estimated number of parsecs (or turns) for command to be completed. Actual distances will be calculated by game and treated as real numbers.

Attack: an attack is displayed much like a Risk melee. Game starts with rolling random percentage of enemy ships destroyed by attackers then for defenders. One note: ships are not lost until next attack round so defenders get correct number of shots. Progress of battle is portrayed in a pop-up as sliding bars showing number of ships remaining on each side. Victory and defeat are announced as icons on battle pop-up. At end of battle. Sound effects would be great here. Will need to slow down battle to add to tension rather than “click, you lost”...

In single play, all moves and turns are immediately performed. In Multi-play, actions will pause till last player presses “send commands” before making any actual attacks or moves. Should 2 players attack same planet on same turn, game will randomly pick one players attack as being first.
